# Take-Home Task: **Web3 Message Signer & Verifier**
React + Dynamic.xyz Headless Implementation (Frontend) | Node.js + Express (Backend)

## üéØ Objective
Build a full-stack Web3 app that allows a user to:
1. Authenticate using a **Dynamic.xyz embedded wallet headless implementation https://docs.dynamic.xyz/headless/headless-email**
2. Enter and **sign a custom message** of the user's choosing
3. Send the signed message to a **Node.js + Express** backend
4. Backend verifies the signature and responds with validity + address

## üîß Requirements

### üß© Frontend (React 18+)
* Integrate Dynamic.xyz Embedded Wallet
* After authentication:
   * Show connected wallet address
   * Provide a form to input a custom message
   * Let user sign the message
   * Submit `{ message, signature }` to backend
* Show result from backend:
   * Whether the signature is valid
   * Which wallet signed it
* Allow signing multiple messages (show a local history)

**Note:** How you structure the React app is up to you ‚Äî but the app complexity is high enough that good React patterns will shine through.

### üåê Backend (Node.js + Express ‚Äì required)
* Create a REST API endpoint: `POST /verify-signature`
* Accept:
```json
{ "message": "string", "signature": "string" }
```
* Use `ethers.js` (or `viem`) to:
   * Recover the signer from the signature
   * Validate the signature
* Return:
```json
{ "isValid": true, "signer": "0xabc123...", "originalMessage": "..." }
```

## Behavior & Constraints
* Session state can be in-memory (no DB required)
* Message signing history should persist across React component state or localStorage
* No third-party signature validation services ‚Äî use raw `ethers.js`, `viem` or similar in backend

## üåê Live Demo

### Deployed Applications
- **Frontend (Vercel)**: https://frotend-signer-message.vercel.app/ - Test the fully deployed app
- **Backend (Railway)**: https://message-signer-production.up.railway.app/ - API endpoint for signature verification

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Dynamic.xyz environment ID (get from https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/developer)

### One-Command Setup
```bash
./start.sh
```

This script will:
- Install all dependencies (frontend & backend)
- Build the backend TypeScript
- Start both services on available ports
- Create/update `.env.local` with correct backend URL
- Display access URLs and logs

### Manual Setup (Alternative)
1. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   # Create frontend/.env.local with:
   # NEXT_PUBLIC_DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT_ID=your_dynamic_env_id
   # NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3001/api

### Testing
```bash
cd backend && npm test
```

## ‚úÖ Evaluation Focus
| Area | Evaluated On |
|------|-------------|
| **React architecture** | Component design, state flow, hooks, separation of concerns |
| **Dynamic.xyz usage** | Clean login, wallet context management, signing flow |
| **Node.js + Express** | REST API correctness, signature validation logic, modularity |
| **Code quality** | Readability, organization, error handling, TypeScript use |
| **User experience** | Clear flows, responsive feedback, intuitive UI |
| **Extensibility** | Evidence of scalable thought (e.g., room for auth, roles, message types) |
| **Design** | Beautiful UX design skills are important to us. Make the app look and feel great |

## üîß Trade-offs & Design Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Next.js API Routes**: Used for backend proxying instead of direct frontend-to-backend calls for better security and flexibility
- **localStorage**: Chosen for history persistence - simple and effective for demo, but could be upgraded to IndexedDB for larger datasets
- **Monorepo Structure**: Single repository with separate frontend/backend folders for easier development and deployment
- **TypeScript**: Used throughout for better type safety and developer experience

### Performance Optimizations
- **Dynamic Imports**: Components are loaded efficiently with Next.js code splitting
- **Virtualized Scrolling**: History component handles many entries with max-height and overflow scroll
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately before backend confirmation for better UX
