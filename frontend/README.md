# Vite + React-TS WEB3 MESSAGE SIGNER AND VERIFIER üîê

- Connect using Dynamic.xyz embedded wallets (via email OTP)
- Sign custom messages using their wallet
- Verify the signature on a Node.js + Express backend via ethers.js

## Features

- Email-based Wallet Authentication : Users can sign in using their email address via Dynamic.xyz, receive a One-Time Password (OTP), and instantly create an embedded wallet with no browser extension required.

- Message Signing via Wallet : After authentication, users can enter a custom message and securely sign it using their Dynamic-connected wallet powered by primaryWallet.signMessage().

- Server-side Signature Verification : The signed message is sent to a backend API built with Express + ethers.js, which verifies the signature and returns the signer address and validity.

- Live Signature Result Feedback : Upon signing, users immediately see whether the signature is valid and which wallet address it was signed by, enhancing trust and clarity.

- Modern Responsive UI : Built with Tailwind CSS and React, the app adapts smoothly to mobile and desktop screen sizes for a consistent user experience.
